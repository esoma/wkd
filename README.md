<h1>wkd</h1>

wkd is a Python library for developing games (or any other media application).

wkd is currently very unstable and incomplete.

## Goals

 * Take advantage of modern Python features including async and subinterpreters
 * Use the cffi library to allow the library to run on more than CPython
 * Run on Windows, Linux and Mac
 * Provide low and high level APIs
 * Abstract away implementation details and unique behaviors of OS, Graphics
   APIs, Physics libraries, etc.
 * Thoroughly test.
 * Provide handwritten documentation with code examples.
